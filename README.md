### Games, experiments, fun side projects - well thatâ€™s the plan...

I like to work on the occasional side project. This helps me to fine tune my skills and learn new tech. The goal is to use this site, as a central place, to host and showcase them.

## Tech

Website (and most components) using React, Redux, Router5 and bootstrapped with Webpack2.

Based on this simple [Webpack2 React seed project](https://github.com/tpina/react-webpack2-seed) and then swapping out the react-router for [Router5](https://github.com/router5/redux-router5) using this [redux-router5 example](https://github.com/router5/examples/tree/master/apps/react-redux)

## How to

**Install dependencies**
```bash
yarn
```
**Run development environment**
```bash
yarn start
```
**Build the development bundle**
```bash
yarn run build-dev
```
**Build the production bundle**
```bash
yarn run build-prod
```
**Run linter**
```bash
yarn run lint
```
**Run tests**
```bash
yarn run test
```

May need to install [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) if get errors with FSEvents on OS X.
